 * The inteface for a record parser that defines the protocol or parsing records
 * from an open channel.
 *
 * To start reading from a file channel, the user of this interface needs to call
 * {@link #setCurrentFile(TrackedFile, boolean) setCurrentFile} with an open file.
 * This file can be called at a later time as needed as the underlying file rotates.
 * After that, successive calls to {@link #readRecord()} will yield the successive
 * records read from the file channel. When no more complete records can be
 * read from the underlying channel, {@code null} will be returned. The caller
 * is then responsible to figure out what's the reason (e.g. simple EOF or
 * rotation happened), and either keep reading from the same file or switching
 * to another file by calling {@code setCurrentFile(TrackedFile, boolean) setCurrentFile}
 * again.
 *
