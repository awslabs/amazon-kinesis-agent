/**
 * Class that manages checkpoint updates per {@link FileFlow flow}.
 * Current implementation only makes sure that for a given {@link FileFlow flow}
 * an older checkpoint arriving late does not overwrite a newer checkpoint.
 *
 * This is not ideal because it could potentially create gaps and lead to data
 * loss, but in normal cases this should happen only rarely.
 *
 * TODO: A future iteration could ensure that checkpoints are created in
 *       sequence such that no gaps are left. This entails waiting for
 *       late-arriving buffers, and could lead to data duplication but
 *       guarantees no data loss.
